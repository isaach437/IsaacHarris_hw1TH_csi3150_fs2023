        My name is Isaac and I am a senior at Oakland University, set to
        graduate in the Fall 2023 Semester. <br />The progress of all my
        finished courses can be found to the right. I am from Michigan and am
        currently
        <br />
        working as a tech support member for now until after I graduate. In the
        future I plan on being some<br />
        kind of developer, however I would most like to become a video game
        developer. I do not have a<br />
        whole lot of experience yet with development, but I have many side
        projects planned to get a good start.<br />
        To learn more about me, check out my
        <a href="/html/my_resume.html">resume</a> or
        <a href="/html/my_fun_facts.html">fun facts</a> pages.
